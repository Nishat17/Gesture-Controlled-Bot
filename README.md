# Gesture-Controlled-Bot

Gesture Controlled Robot is a robot which can be controlled by simple gestures. 
The user just needs to wear a gesture device which includes a sensor. 
The sensor will record the movement of hand in a specific direction which will result in the movement of the robot in the respective direction. 
The robot and the Gesture device are connected wirelessly via radio waves. 
Thus, such gesture-based interfaces can not only substitute the common  
interface devices but can also be exploited to extend their functionality.
